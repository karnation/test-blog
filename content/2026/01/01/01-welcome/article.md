# Welcome to Scribere
By Example Author

This example site ships with the Scribere engine so you can run the build and view a real page immediately, without any extra setup. Use it as a working reference, then replace these posts with your own writing when you are ready.

The system keeps content in dated folders and builds static pages from plain Markdown, which keeps the archive legible as it grows. If you remove these example posts but keep the same folder structure, the site will still build correctly and the templates will continue to work.
