# Hello World: My First Scribere Post
By Karmen Hardy

Welcome to my newly launched blog! This is the first post I've written since setting up the Scribere engine and the automated GitHub Pages deployment.

The setup was smooth, and now I can write posts in plain Markdown and have them live in minutes. 

## Project Goals
I plan to write more about my projects and personal thoughts. More updates will follow in the coming weeks.
